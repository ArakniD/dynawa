TCH1 from Dynawa is the first completely customizable wrist computer system with full hardware documentation and open source code.

This micro-computer is equipped with RISC processor, expandable storage, full-color display, Bluetooth radio, accelerometer, micro-USB connector and sound output. TCH1 is primarily intended to be used as a smart watch / terminal communicating with your mobile phone via Bluetooth but if you intend, you can use it for wildly different things.

If you don't want to write your own firmware, this is a project for creating the "official", "Dynawa-approved" firmware.
